# Stand-alone-air-pollution-monitoring-system-in-stone-srushing-plants-using-STM32
This project uses an STM32F401RE to create a standalone air quality monitor for stone crushing areas. It uses MQ135, LM35, and LDR sensors to detect pollution and human presence, triggering alerts via buzzer/LED and sending messages via serial, all without internet.
